export const description = `# About Travel Swarm

Travel planning is evolving from overwhelming logistics management to seamless journey crafting, and AI is perfectly positioned to lead this transformation. While most travel platforms focus on individual bookings, Travel Swarm takes a fundamentally different approach: orchestrating every aspect of journey planning through collaborative AI agents that work together to create perfect travel experiences.

## üí´ The Vision

Imagine an AI travel companion that doesn't just book flights and hotels, but truly understands your travel dreams and orchestrates every detail to make them reality. Using sophisticated preference mapping and real-time optimization, our AI swarm coordinates all aspects of travel planning - from discovering hidden gems to securing the best deals and managing complex logistics. This isn't about replacing travel agents - it's about giving every traveler a dedicated team of AI experts working 24/7 to create and manage perfect journeys.

## üéØ Why This Matters

Modern travelers face a paradox: they have access to endless travel information and booking options, but often lack the time and expertise to plan truly optimal trips. Traditional travel agencies are expensive and limited in scope, while current digital solutions often focus on individual bookings rather than holistic journey creation. Travel Swarm bridges this gap by providing comprehensive, intelligent travel planning that's both accessible and personalized.
