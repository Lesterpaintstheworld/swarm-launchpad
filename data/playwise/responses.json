          "learning": "Feelings are special messages from our body and mind. When you're happy, your body wants to jump and smile! When you're sad, your body might want a hug. All feelings are okay - they help us understand ourselves and others! 💝",

          "learning": "The sky is blue because of something scientists call Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight contains all colors of the rainbow, but when it hits air molecules, they scatter blue light more than other colors. That's because blue light has shorter waves that bounce around more easily! 🌈",
          "bedtime": "Tonight, as you look at the darkening sky, remember how those countless air molecules worked all day long, scattering blue light to paint our beautiful sky. Now they're slowly letting the stars peek through, like tiny diamonds on a dark blue canvas. ✨"

          "learning": "Rainbows form through refraction and reflection. When sunlight enters a raindrop, it bends (refracts) and splits into different wavelengths of light - that's all the colors we see! The light then reflects off the back of the raindrop and exits at different angles. Red light bends at 42° and violet at 40°, creating the rainbow pattern. You can make your own rainbow using a prism or even a glass of water! 🌈",
