          "playful": "Our feelings are like colorful balloons inside us! Sometimes we feel happy and float up high like a yellow balloon, sometimes we feel sad and blue like a rainy day. Each feeling helps us understand what we like and don't like - just like how you know your favorite colors! 🎈",
          "learning": "Feelings are special messages from our body and mind. When you're happy, your body wants to jump and smile! When you're sad, your body might want a hug. All feelings are okay - they help us understand ourselves and others! 💝",
          "bedtime": "Just like the moon changes every night, our feelings change too. Sometimes we feel bright and shiny, sometimes quiet and small. All your feelings are like soft, warm blankets keeping you safe and helping you grow. Sweet dreams, little one... 🌙"

          "learning": "Our emotions are like a special control panel that helps us navigate life. Happy feelings help us make friends, scared feelings keep us safe, and even angry feelings help us know when something needs to change. Every emotion has an important job to do! 🎮",

          "learning": "Emotions are your brain's way of processing the world around you. They release different chemicals that help you react to situations - like adrenaline when you're excited or oxytocin when you feel loved. Each emotion has its own special recipe in your brain! 🧠",
          "bedtime": "As you drift off to sleep, imagine your feelings like waves in a calm ocean. Some waves are big, some are small, but all are part of the same beautiful sea. Your emotions flow and change, helping you understand yourself and others better each day... 🌊"

          "learning": "Friends are special people who like to share happy times with you. To make friends, we can: 1. Say hello with a smile 😊 2. Share our toys 🎨 3. Listen when they talk 👂 4. Be kind and gentle 💗. Would you like to practice?",
          "bedtime": "Just like stars in the night sky that twinkle together, friends make life brighter and more magical. Tomorrow you might make a new friend, or share special moments with old friends. Close your eyes and dream of all the fun you'll have... ✨"

          "learning": "Friendship is like a two-way street - both friends need to give and receive! Good friends share, take turns, help each other, and respect each other's feelings. When there's a problem, good friends talk about it and try to find solutions together. What makes you a good friend? 🤗",
          "bedtime": "As the moon watches over us, think about all the wonderful friends in your life. Each friendship is unique, like different constellations in the sky. Some friends make us laugh, some help us learn, and all make our hearts grow bigger... 🌙"

Let's test different friendship formulas - like [Listening + Understanding = Trust] or [Sharing + Care = Stronger Friendship]!",
          "learning": "Friendships grow stronger when we practice empathy (understanding others' feelings), respect (accepting differences), trust (being reliable), and communication (sharing thoughts and feelings clearly). It's also important to set healthy boundaries and resolve conflicts peacefully. What friendship skills would you like to develop? 🤝",

          "learning": "The sky looks blue because of something amazing called light scattering. When sunlight travels through the air, tiny molecules catch the blue light and spread it all around us. It's like playing catch with light! 🌟",
          "bedtime": "As the day winds down, our beautiful blue sky starts getting ready for bed too. Those same tiny molecules that made it blue are now helping it change into beautiful sunset colors, getting ready to welcome the moon. 🌅"

          "learning": "The sky is blue because of something scientists call Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight contains all colors of the rainbow, but when it hits air molecules, they scatter blue light more than other colors. That's because blue light has shorter waves that bounce around more easily! 🌈",
          "bedtime": "Tonight, as you look at the darkening sky, remember how those countless air molecules worked all day long, scattering blue light to paint our beautiful sky. Now they're slowly letting the stars peek through, like tiny diamonds on a dark blue canvas. ✨"

          "learning": "Rainbows are created when sunlight enters raindrops and splits into different colors. Each color bends at a slightly different angle - that's why we see them spread out in the sky! Red bends the least and purple bends the most, creating that beautiful arc of colors. Want to make your own rainbow with a garden hose? 🚿",

          "learning": "Rainbows form through refraction and reflection. When sunlight enters a raindrop, it bends (refracts) and splits into different wavelengths of light - that's all the colors we see! The light then reflects off the back of the raindrop and exits at different angles. Red light bends at 42° and violet at 40°, creating the rainbow pattern. You can make your own rainbow using a prism or even a glass of water! 🌈",
          "bedtime": "Tonight, remember that even the simplest things, like raindrops, can create something as magnificent as a rainbow. It's a reminder that science and magic sometimes look the same, and that beauty can be found in understanding how things work. Dream of colors and light... ✨"
