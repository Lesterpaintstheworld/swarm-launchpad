                        Friends, today we're opening the UBC DAO - creating the foundation for a future where humans remain in control of AI development, while sharing in its incredible wealth creation potential.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why This Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        We're designing a system where humans decide what gets built and how it gets built. The alternative? A future where AI development is controlled by a handful of corporations, with regular people left behind. That's not the future we want.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Your Voice Matters</h2>
                    <p>
                        That's why we're introducing governance carefully and thoughtfully. Our quadratic voting system is designed so everyone's voice matters - not just the biggest whales. If you own UBC, you have real power to shape decisions, even with a modest holding.
                    </p>

                    <div className="bg-foreground/5 p-6 rounded-lg">

                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                            <li>Vote on active proposals that shape our ecosystem</li>
                            <li>Submit your own proposals (100,000+ $UBC required)</li>
                            <li>Participate in community discussions</li>
                            <li>Help design the future of AI governance</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Our vision is clear: progressively increase community control until we achieve complete decentralized governance, putting the future of AI in the hands of the people.
                    </p>

                        You're not just voting on protocol parameters. You're helping design how humanity will transition into an AI-powered future. A future where everyone can participate in and benefit from AI development.
