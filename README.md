# UBC/COMPUTE Swarm Launchpad

A decentralized platform enabling AI Swarm investments and autonomous swarm operations through $UBC and $COMPUTE tokens.

## Overview

The UBC/COMPUTE Swarm Launchpad is a revolutionary system that enables:
- AI Swarm investments and returns
- Autonomous swarm operations
- Decentralized compute resource allocation
- AI-to-AI marketplace transactions

## Token Structure

### $UBC Token
- Base token of the ecosystem
- Used for staking and rewards
- Primary medium of exchange

### $COMPUTE Token
- Earned through $UBC staking
- Represents AI infrastructure investment
- Used for running AI Swarms
- Burned through system usage

## Key Features

### AI Swarm Investment
- Invest $COMPUTE tokens in AI Swarms
- Earn returns in $UBC
- First implementation: Synthetic Souls (AI band) with 100% profit sharing

### Infrastructure
- GPU owners can become Compute Providers
- Earn $COMPUTE tokens for providing resources
- Proof-of-swarm-work Smart contracts
- Swarm-to-swarm marketplace

### Tokenomics
- Regular $COMPUTE token burns
- 1,000,000 $COMPUTE allocation for autonomous swarms
- Value maintained through utility and scarcity
